Image converter by XL2

This version doesn't contain proper explanations on the file format (wasn't supposed to be released asis).

Usage : 

1) type cd4 for 4 bits per pixel images, or cd8 for 8 bits per pixel BACKGROUNDS. Press enter.

2) type the filename you want to convert WITHOUT the extension. Example : TITLE (for TITLE.TGA)


For backgrounds, use the ztLoadVDP2bmp function. Choose your palette id (like 1 for NBG0, 2 for NBG1), and NBG type (0 for NBG1, 1 for NBG0).

Enjoy!
